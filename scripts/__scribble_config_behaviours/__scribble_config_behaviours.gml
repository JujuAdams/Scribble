#macro SCRIBBLE_BGR_COLOR_HEX_CODES           false  //Set to <true> to use GameMaker's #BBGGRR format for in-line hex code colors. <false> uses the web standard #RRGGBB format

#macro SCRIBBLE_FLEXIBLE_WHITESPACE_WIDTH     true   //Controls if spaces and tabs have a fixed, unchanging size. Setting this to <false> will ensure that spaces are always the same size, which is useful for monospaced fonts

#macro SCRIBBLE_ALLOW_TEXT_GETTER             false  //Set to <true> to enable the .get_text() method on text elements. This will apply to all text elements and carries a performance penalty
#macro SCRIBBLE_ALLOW_GLYPH_DATA_GETTER       false  //Set to <true> to enable the .get_glyph_data() method on text elements (and a few other features too). This will apply to all text elements and carries a performance penalty

#macro SCRIBBLE_TICK_SIZE                      (delta_time / 16666) //Animation tick size per step. The default macro (delta_time / 16666) ensures that animations are smooth and consistent at all framerates
#macro SCRIBBLE_DEFAULT_UNIQUE_ID              ":default" //Default value to use for text element unique IDs. This is used when no unique ID is specified. This value must be a string, and must start with a colon (:)

#macro SCRIBBLE_BEZIER_ACCURACY                20         //Controls how accurately text fits Beziér curves. Higher is more accurate but slower
#macro SCRIBBLE_NEWLINES_TRIM_LEFT_SPACE       false      //Whether to trim off empty left-hand space when moving a word to a new line. This can cause issues with spritefonts in some situations
#macro SCRIBBLE_NEWLINES_PAD_LEFT_SPACE        true       //Whether to pad extra space left-hand space when moving a word to a new line
#macro SCRIBBLE_FIT_TO_BOX_ITERATIONS          7          //Number of iterations to fit text when using the .fit_to_box() method. Higher values are slower but more accurate

#macro SCRIBBLE_IGNORE_PAUSE_BEFORE_PAGEBREAK  true       //Disables [pause] events immediately before pagebreaks, though only if there are no other events between the pause and the pagebreak
#macro SCRIBBLE_INCREMENTAL_FREEZE             true       //Whether text models should freeze their vertex buffers one frame after the text model is created. This leads to increased performance, especially with large amounts of text
#macro SCRIBBLE_SPRITEFONT_IGNORE_ORIGIN       false      //Set to <true> to ignore a sprite origin's contribution to its spritefont glyph x/y offsets
#macro SCRIBBLE_SPRITEFONT_LEGACY_HEIGHT       false      //Version 8 uses GameMaker's native spritefont dimensions. Older versions used the tight bounding box leading to narrower lines. Set this macro to <true> to use the tighter legacy behaviour
